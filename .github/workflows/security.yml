            ## Security Audit Failed

            The daily security audit has detected high severity vulnerabilities.

            **Action Required:**
            1. Run \`npm audit\` in \`02-whatsapp-bot/\` to see details
            2. Run \`npm audit fix\` to attempt automatic fixes
            3. If automatic fix fails, manually update the affected packages

            **Workflow Run:** ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
