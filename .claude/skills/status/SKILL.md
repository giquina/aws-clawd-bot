# Status Check

Read and summarize the current state of the project:

1. **TODO/tasks files** - What's pending, in progress, blocked
2. **Project registry state** (config/project-registry.json, config/chat-registry.json)
3. **Recent commits** (last 5 from git log)
4. **Open PRs** if any
5. **Active skills** from skills/skills.json

Report in a clean format:
- ✅ What's done
- 🔄 What's in progress
- 🚫 What's blocked
- 📋 What's next

Keep it concise - bullet points only.
